## About The Project

The primary goal of this project was to eliminate manual data exports and empower the company's executive team with reliable, near-real-time KPIs. The solution involved architecting a data pipeline that captures CRM data through two methods: a daily incremental API sync and real-time webhook ingestion for critical events.

All data is stored in a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database on Render, which serves as the single source of truth for a suite of 8 interactive Power BI dashboards.

**Business Impact:**
* **Eliminated Manual Work:** Replaced hours of weekly work spent on consolidating Excel exports.
* **Real-Time Visibility:** Executives now have live insights into sales performance, conversion rates, and pipeline health.
* **Improved Data Reliability:** Created a trusted, centralized data source, ensuring consistent KPIs across all reports.
* **Enhanced Traceability:** Every key CRM event is captured and stored for full auditability.

## Key Features

- **8 Interactive Power BI Dashboards:** Covering sales performance, pipeline tracking, executive activity, conversion rates, and monthly trends.
- **Fully Automated Cloud ETL:** Python scripts run on a daily schedule to incrementally sync new and updated lead data from the the CRM API.
- **Real-Time Event Ingestion:** A Flask webhook service instantly captures critical events like `lead.creation`, `lead.deleted`, and `lead.status.changed`.
- **Cloud-Hosted Database:** A robust PostgreSQL instance on Render serves as the data warehouse, accessible directly by Power BI.
- **Optimized Data Model:** A normalized schema with strategic indexing to ensure fast query performance for Power BI dashboards.
- **Standardized DAX Library:** A central set of documented DAX measures ensures metric consistency across all reports.

### 1. Database Schema & Data Model

The data from these webhooks feeds a structured reporting system in Power BI. The ecosystem is designed as follows:

* **Database Tables**: Each office has three primary tables that are populated by the webhooks. Each table includes a `raw_data` column of type `jsonb` to store the complete, unaltered JSON payload from the webhook for full traceability and future analysis.

    * `lead_created`: This table logs an entry whenever a new lead is created for the first time.
      *Table Structure:*
      | Column Name        | Data Type |
      | ------------------ | --------- |
      | id                 | int8      |
      | event              | text      |
      | signature          | text      |
      | has_succeeded      | bool      |
      | try_count          | int4      |
      | last_returned_code | int4      |
      | received_at        | timestamp |
      | lead_id            | int8      |
      | title              | text      |
      | status             | text      |
      | step               | text      |
      | amount             | numeric   |
      | created_at_utc     | timestamp |
      | updated_at_utc     | timestamp |
      | user_email         | text      |
      | permalink          | text      |
      | raw_data           | jsonb     |
      | client_folder_id   | int8      |
      | client_folder_name | text      |

    * `step_changed`: A new row is added to this table every time an action or status change is applied to an existing lead, creating a complete event history.
      *Table Structure:*
      | Column Name        | Data Type   |
      | ------------------ | ----------- |
      | id                 | int8        |
      | event              | text        |
      | signature          | text        |
      | has_succeeded      | bool        |
      | try_count          | int4        |
      | last_returned_code | int4        |
      | received_at        | timestamptz |
      | lead_id            | int8        |
      | lead_title         | text        |
      | lead_status        | text        |
      | lead_step          | text        |
      | lead_amount        | numeric     |
      | lead_created_at    | timestamptz |
      | lead_updated_at    | timestamptz |
      | lead_user_email    | text        |
      | lead_permalink     | text        |
      | raw_data           | jsonb       |
      | step_id            | int4        |
      | pipeline           | text        |
      | created_at_utc     | timestamptz |
      | updated_at_utc     | timestamptz |
      | moved_by           | text        |

    * `client_folder_created`: This table tracks the creation of new folders, which typically represent a new real estate agent who will manage a portfolio of leads.
      *Table Structure:*
      | Column Name        | Data Type |
      | ------------------ | --------- |

### 2. ETL & API Synchronization

The ETL process is responsible for both the initial historical data load and the ongoing daily synchronization of new data.

#### **Initial Historical Backfill Strategy**
A significant challenge at the project's outset was retrieving the complete history of all leads and their associated actions dating back to **2018**. The CRM API had a hard limit of **2,000 requests per day**, and with each lead potentially having hundreds of individual actions, a purely API-based backfill was mathematically impossible.

To overcome this, a **hybrid strategy** was implemented:
1.  **Initial Lead Ingestion:** A Python script (shown below) was used to paginate through the API and download the core data for every lead from all three company offices. This captured the primary lead details and the *last known action* for each and insert it in a local database.
2.  **Full Action History Load:** We then requested a complete, one-time database export (as a file) directly from the CRM support team. This file contained the full action history for every lead.
3.  **Manual Data Ingestion:** Using the command-line interface for PostgreSQL, this historical action data was manually uploaded and inserted into the `action_history` table in the **Render** database.

This approach successfully recreated the entire lead history by merging the manually uploaded data with the live data being captured by the webhooks, creating a complete and accurate historical record.

### Ongoing Data Synchronization via Webhooks

After the initial historical backfill, all ongoing data updates are handled in **real-time using webhooks** configured between CRM and the Flask API hosted on Render. This approach bypasses the need for daily API calls, ensuring that any change in the CRM is reflected in the PostgreSQL database within seconds.

Four key webhooks are configured for each of the three company offices, which trigger on specific CRM events. Each webhook populates a corresponding table in the database to log the event and store its full JSON payload for traceability.

This is an example of how the script to get the Initial Lead Ingestion using the API looks:

```python
import requests
import sqlite3
import time
from datetime import datetime
import pytz

# API and DB config
API_KEY = 'API KEY'
URL = 'URL'
DB_FILE = r'C:\sqlite\database.db'
HEADERS = {
    'X-API-KEY': API_KEY,
    'Accept': 'application/json'
}
LIMIT = 100

# Timezone handling
crm_timezone = pytz.timezone('insert your time zone here')

def convert_to_crm_timezone(utc_datetime_str):
    if not utc_datetime_str:
        return None
    
    # Try parsing full timestamp first
    try:
        utc_dt = datetime.strptime(utc_datetime_str, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ")
    except ValueError:
        try:
            # Try parsing simple date format
            utc_dt = datetime.strptime(utc_datetime_str, "%Y-%m-%d")
        except ValueError:
            print(f"Unrecognized date format: {utc_datetime_str}")
            return None
    
    # Set timezone info
    utc_dt = utc_dt.replace(tzinfo=pytz.utc)
    crm_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(crm_timezone)
    return crm_dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

# Date range for API request
start_date = '2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'
end_date = '2025-12-31T23:59:59.999Z'
date_range_type = 'creation'
offset = 0
all_leads = []

# Fetch data from API
while True:
    params = {
        'limit': LIMIT,
        'offset': offset,
        'start_date': start_date,
        'end_date': end_date,
        'date_range_type': date_range_type
    }
    response = requests.get(URL, headers=HEADERS, params=params)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print("Error al consultar la API:", response.status_code, response.text)
        break
    leads = response.json()
    print(f"Offset {offset}: {len(leads)} leads")
    if not leads:
        break
    all_leads.extend(leads)
    offset += LIMIT
    time.sleep(0.2)

print(f"Total de leads traídos: {len(all_leads)}")

### 3. Real-Time Webhook Ingestion

A lightweight Flask application, designed for cloud deployment, listens for incoming webhooks from CRM.io. It acts as the real-time data ingestion engine, immediately processing events and inserting them into the appropriate PostgreSQL tables.

#### Architecture & Logic

The application is built to handle multiple company accounts (e.g., `office_a`, `office_b`, `office_c`) from a single, scalable service.

* **Dynamic Routing**: A single endpoint `/webhook/<account>` dynamically captures the account name from the URL. This allows the service to route data to the correct set of database tables (e.g., requests to `/webhook/ofice_a` will interact with tables like `ofice_a_lead_created`).
* **Secure & Robust**: The handler validates the account against a whitelist to prevent unauthorized access. It uses `psycopg2` with parameterized queries (`sql.Identifier`) to safely construct table names and prevent SQL injection. Database credentials are securely managed using environment variables.
* **Event-Driven Functions**: Each webhook event (`lead.creation`, `lead.step.changed`, etc.) is mapped to a dedicated Python function that formats the payload and inserts it into the corresponding table. The `ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING` clause ensures data integrity by preventing duplicate entries.

#### Flask Webhook Handler (`webhook_app.py`)

This is the complete code for the webhook listener service.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

    'host': os.environ.get('DB_HOST'),
    'port': int(os.environ.get('DB_PORT', 5432))

### 4. Power BI Implementation

The final layer of this project is the Power BI visualization suite, which serves as the primary interface for business users. The reports connect to the PostgreSQL database on Render using the **Import** method, which copies the data into the Power BI files for optimal performance.

To keep the dashboards current, an **automatic refresh schedule** is configured in the Power BI service. The dataset is updated **eight times daily** during business hours, ensuring that managers and agents have access to timely and relevant data throughout the day.

#### Data Modeling & DAX

Each Power BI report (`.pbix` file) contains a sophisticated data model built on top of the imported data tables. To support complex analytical requirements, each model was heavily customized.

* **Over 8 Calculated Tables:** Created using DAX to handle dimensions like dynamic calendars, sales goals (`oficina_a_Meta_Anual`, `Meta_Mensual_Asesores`), and other helper tables that enrich the raw data.
* **More than 60 DAX Measures:** A comprehensive library of custom measures was written to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as conversion rates, ticket averages, sales funnel progression, and progress towards monthly and annual goals.

This entire data model structure, including all calculated tables and measures, is replicated for both the Manager and Agent reports in each of the three offices, ensuring analytical consistency and scalability across the organization.

#### Dashboard Showcase

Two primary types of dashboards were developed for each office to serve different business needs:

* **Manager Dashboard:** Provides a comprehensive, office-level overview of sales performance. It includes a full sales funnel (from referred to signed), ticket averages, total sales amounts, agent leaderboards, and progress against team-wide goals. The interface allows managers to filter results by month, year, and individual agent to get a clear picture of the team's health.

*Some parts have been blurred.*

* **Agent Dashboard:** Designed for individual sales agents to track their personal performance. This report focuses on individual monthly and annual sales goals, personal conversion rates at each stage of the sales pipeline (e.g., `Firmados vs Ingresados`), and a detailed breakdown of their signed deals. This view empowers agents to monitor their own progress and identify areas for improvement.

## Deployment on Render

The entire backend infrastructure for this project is hosted on Render, providing a scalable and easy-to-manage environment for both the web service and the database.

### Web Service Configuration

A single **Python web service** was deployed to handle all real-time data ingestion. Key features of this setup include:

* **Git-Based Auto-Deploy:** The service is directly linked to the project's GitHub repository. Any push to the `main` branch automatically triggers a new deployment, ensuring the latest code is always live.
* **Centralized Webhook Listener:** This single service is architected to process webhooks from all three distinct CRM accounts. It uses the dynamic routing logic in the Flask `app.py` script to receive data and direct it to the appropriate database tables based on the incoming URL.

### Database & Environment Management

The PostgreSQL database is also a managed service on Render, co-located with the web service for low-latency connections.

* **Secure Credential Management:** All sensitive information—including database connection details (`DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_PASS`), API keys (`CRM_API_KEY`), and other secrets—is managed using **Render's Environment Groups**. These secrets are securely injected into the application at runtime, avoiding the need to hardcode them in the source code. This single environment group provides the credentials needed for the service to connect to the database and populate the nine distinct tables (three for each office).


## Final Notes and Contact

If I get any people interested in getting the full PBIXs, DAX measures, and scripts, then I'll make sure to upload those files with the necessary mock data.
